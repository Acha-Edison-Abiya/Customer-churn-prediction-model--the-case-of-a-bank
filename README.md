# Customer-churn-prediction-model--the-case-of-a-bank
This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict whether bank customers will churn or not. The churn rate - rate at which bank customers stop doing business with the bank. 

### Results from Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- 1. Geographical Distribution: The majority of the bank’s customers are from France, with Spain having the lowest churn rate, indicating better customer retention in Spain compared to France and Germany.
- 2.	Credit Card Ownership: A large proportion of customers own credit cards, reflecting the widespread adoption or availability of credit card products among the bank’s clientele.
- 3.	Age and Credit Score Diversity: The customer base includes individuals over 60 years old and those with credit scores below 400. However, these characteristics do not appear as outliers, suggesting a broad range of age and credit scores among customers.
- 4.	Bank Product Usage: Most customers utilize one or two of the bank’s products, with very few using more than two. This indicates limited cross-selling opportunities or customer interest in multiple products.
- 5.	Customer Engagement and Churn: Customers who are less active in their banking activities are more likely to churn, suggesting that engagement is a critical factor in retaining customers.
- 6.	Gender and Tenure: Gender and the length of time a customer has been with the bank (tenure) do not significantly impact their likelihood of churn, indicating these factors are less critical in predicting customer attrition.


### Relationship Between Categorical Variables and Target Variable (Churn)
- 1. Geography: The churn rate varies by geographical location, with customers in Germany showing a higher likelihood of churning compared to those in France and Spain. This suggests that regional factors may influence customer retention.
- 2. Gender: The analysis indicated no significant difference in churn rates between male and female customers, implying that gender does not strongly influence the likelihood of a customer leaving the bank.
- 3. Credit Card Ownership: Customers with and without credit cards displayed similar churn rates, indicating that having a credit card does not significantly affect customer retention.
- 4. Active Member Status: Customers who are not actively engaged with the bank are more likely to churn. This highlights the importance of customer engagement in reducing attrition.
- 5. Number of Products: Customers using more than two products are more likely to churn, despite a lower overall number of such customers. This suggests that complexity or dissatisfaction with multiple products might drive some customers to leave.
- 6. Tenure: The number of years a customer has been with the bank (tenure) showed no strong correlation with churn, indicating that long-term customers are not necessarily more loyal than newer ones.
