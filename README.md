# Customer-churn-prediction-model--the-case-of-a-bank
This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict whether bank customers will churn or not. The churn rate - rate at which bank customers stop doing business with the bank. 


### Relationship Between Categorical Variables and Target Variable (Churn)
- 1. Geography: The churn rate varies by geographical location, with customers in Germany showing a higher likelihood of churning compared to those in France and Spain. This suggests that regional factors may influence customer retention.
- 2. Gender: The analysis indicated no significant difference in churn rates between male and female customers, implying that gender does not strongly influence the likelihood of a customer leaving the bank.
- 3. Credit Card Ownership: Customers with and without credit cards displayed similar churn rates, indicating that having a credit card does not significantly affect customer retention.
- 4. Active Member Status: Customers who are not actively engaged with the bank are more likely to churn. This highlights the importance of customer engagement in reducing attrition.
- 5. Number of Products: Customers using more than two products are more likely to churn, despite a lower overall number of such customers. This suggests that complexity or dissatisfaction with multiple products might drive some customers to leave.
- 6. Tenure: The number of years a customer has been with the bank (tenure) showed no strong correlation with churn, indicating that long-term customers are not necessarily more loyal than newer ones.
